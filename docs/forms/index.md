# `Centum\Forms`

Forms are used for validating and processing data by taking advantage of the [Filter](../filter/index.md) and [Validator](../validator/index.md) components.
They provide a structured way of handling input data, ensuring that values are properly sanitised and verified before being used in your application.
By combining filters and validators, forms help reduce boilerplate code and encourage a consistent approach to input handling across different parts of your system.
This makes them especially useful for handling user-submitted data, API requests, or any situation where structured validation is required.
