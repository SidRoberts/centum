# `Centum\Http`

Centum's HTTP component provides classes and interfaces for handling HTTP requests and responses, cookies, headers, and file uploads.
It is designed to help you build robust web applications by abstracting common HTTP operations.



## Main Classes

- [`Centum\Http\Request`](./requests.md) — Represents an HTTP request.
- [`Centum\Http\Response`](./responses.md) — Represents an HTTP response.
- [`Centum\Http\Cookies`](./cookies.md) — Manages a collection of cookies.
- [`Centum\Http\Headers`](./headers.md) — Manages HTTP headers.
- [`Centum\Http\Files`](./files.md) — Handles uploaded files.
